1. Check whether the device is properly powered on.
2. Check whether the device was powered off or disconnected from the network. If the connection was closed before, it will take some time for the device to go online again. Please wait for 2 minutes and check whether the device is online.
3. Check whether the device network is stable. Troubleshooting: connect the phone or iPad to the same network, put it near the device, and try opening a webpage.
4. Check whether the family Wi-Fi network is normal or the Wi-Fi network name, password, or another attribute has been modified; and if yes, reset the device and add it again.
5. If the network is normal but the device is still offline, please check whether too many devices are connected to the Wi-Fi networks. You can restart the router, power off and then power on the device, and wait for 2–3 minutes to see whether it can be connected again.
6. Check whether the firmware is on the latest version. You can go to Me > Settings > About > Check for Update in the app to check the version.
If the problem still persists, we recommend you remove the device and add it again. If this still does not work, please select the device in user feedback in the app, provide the login account and device ID, and submit the feedback. Our technical support team will get back to you soon.";

2. Make sure that the device is in network configuration mode (with the indicator blinking slowly or quickly), and the indicator status matches the app's network configuration status.
3. Make sure that the device, phone, and router are near to each other.

4. Make sure that the device network is smooth and stable. Troubleshooting: connect the phone or iPad to the same network, put it near the device, and try opening a webpage.

5. Make sure that the entered router password is correct. Note that there should be no spaces before and after the password.
6. Make sure that the 2.4G Wi-Fi band is used to add the device, and broadcast needs to be enabled for Wi-Fi, which should not be hidden. Check whether 2.4G and 5G bands share the same SSID. We recommend you assign different SSIDs to them.

7. Make sure that the encryption method is WPA2-PSK and the authentication type is AES, or both are set to automatic in the router's wireless settings. The wireless mode cannot be 11n only.

8. If the number of devices connected to the router reaches the upper limit, you can try turning off Wi-Fi on another device to make a channel idle and configure again.

9. If wireless MAC address filtering is enabled on the router, you can try removing the device from the MAC list of the router to ensure that the router does not prohibit the device from connecting to the network.
10. Make sure that the DHCP service has been enabled on the router; otherwise, the address may be occupied.
11. If the problem persists, the router may be incompatible with the device. We recommend you try again with another router.";
